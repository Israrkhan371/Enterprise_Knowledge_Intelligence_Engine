# Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Engine (EKIE)

Ezitech AI-007 case study — central AI intelligence layer over organizational knowledge.

## Architecture

```
Ingestion (loaders + OCR + chunking)
        v
Embedding pipeline (sentence-transformers) -> ChromaDB (vector store)
        v
Entity/relationship extraction (spaCy) -> Neo4j (knowledge graph)
        v
Search layer: semantic | keyword (Postgres FTS) | hybrid (RRF) | metadata | context-aware
        v
RAG answer generation (Claude) + citation verification
        v
Intelligence layer: duplicate detection, staleness detection, gap detection,
                     comparison, summarization, ranking
        v
Admin layer: upload/approve/categories/analytics/quality  (FastAPI + Postgres)
        v
Evaluation: precision/recall/MRR against a labeled query set, tracked in MLflow
Monitoring: Prometheus metrics at /metrics
```

## Quickstart

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up --build
```

- API: http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI, auto-generated)
- Neo4j browser: http://localhost:7474
- MLflow UI: http://localhost:5000
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

## Project layout

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `app/ingestion/` | Source loaders, OCR fallback, chunking |
| `app/embeddings/` | Embedding model wrapper, Chroma vector store |
| `app/search/` | Semantic, keyword, hybrid, context-aware search |
| `app/graph/` | Entity/relationship extraction, Neo4j read/write |
| `app/rag/` | Answer generation, citation verification, doc intelligence (duplicates, staleness, gaps, comparison, summarization) |
| `app/admin/` | Upload, approval workflow, categories, analytics, quality endpoints |
| `app/evaluation/` | Retrieval evaluation harness (precision/recall/MRR), MLflow logging |
| `app/core/` | Config, DB session, ORM models |

## Scope decisions (documented per case-study evaluation criteria)

This scaffold wires up **every** functional requirement in the spec as a working
endpoint, prioritizing breadth first (Week 1-3) then hardening via evaluation
(Week 4) — see the accompanying `EKIE_4Week_Tracker.xlsx` for the day-by-day plan
mapped to each requirement.

- **Source loaders** ship for PDF, docx, markdown, transcripts, and GitHub repos
  out of the box (`app/ingestion/loaders.py`) — add office-file and LMS-export
  loaders the same way by registering a new function in `SOURCE_LOADERS`.
- **Keyword search** uses Postgres full-text search rather than standing up
  Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, to keep infra light; swap in `app/search/keyword.py`
  if you need BM25-grade ranking at larger scale.
- **Relationship extraction** starts as sentence-level co-occurrence
  (`app/graph/extract.py`) — the noted upgrade path is an LLM-based relation
  labeler once you have ingestion volume to justify the extra latency/cost.
- **Bonus feature implemented:** AI Citation Verification (`app/rag/citation_check.py`)
  and Knowledge Gap Detection (`app/rag/intelligence.py::detect_knowledge_gaps`) —
  both reuse infrastructure already built for the core requirements.

## Running tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
pytest tests/
```

## Next steps

1. Fill in `app/evaluation/eval_set.json` with real Q&A pairs and their correct
   source document IDs, then hit `POST /api/v1/evaluation/run`.
2. Add a GIN index for Postgres full-text search (see comment in
   `app/search/keyword.py`) before load-testing keyword/hybrid search.
3. Wire `app/search/context_aware.py::rewrite_query` to a live LLM call —
   it's stubbed to a pass-through for now.
